# LuaLck

This is lua locks code wrapper. You add your obfuscated code into script.lua run the batch and it will secure it, this is in beta and your env must support loadstring.

Todo:
- Use custom VM / compiler instead of loadstring
- Improve encryption
- Better compression


Lua lock is the first obfuscator ringo founder blue made it was an IB fork and was horse shit but the name is still used and he still ran the obf with huge changes just unreleased but i was told to make a code securer as an extra layer of security so i made this. It uses some shit from blue's open source encryption project (broken) aristois. This will eventually replace aristois as it is way more secure with better anti tamper mechanics i just need to finish some stuff before releasing. It will be semi open source the file where we set the encryption key etc (the main file) will not be open source but anyone will be able to use it.
